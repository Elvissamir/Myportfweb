                I'm a passionate software developer and systems engineering student (I'll graduate this year, 2022). My goal is to help you design and develop quality systems that solve real problems and make a difference. In my opinion, good practices and testing are an integral component of the software development process, no matter how big or small the project is. 
                I enjoy learning new things, working out, listening to music, and cooking. 
                Alright, I look forward to hearing from you and working together.
